# Introduction
This is an ASP.Net Core Api blog application, its is **not finished**.

# Features Implemented
- Seed of all models with Bogus(the Faker nuget package for dotnet)
- Controllers: Article, Comment, Tags, Categories, Following/Followers
- Authentication/Authorization(partially)
- Jwt with Identity integration

# Todo
- Add default role when user is registered
- Refactor all the services code, it should be an implementation of an interface. As I did for the Ecommerce Api App(on my github as well).
